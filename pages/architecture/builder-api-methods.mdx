# Builder API Methods

This reference outlines the methods that are exposed to contract authors for building a `GatewayRequest` to read data from other chains.

Internally these methods utilize [OP codes](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways/blob/b109adcfe29c50d19efae93129a689a213d692dc/contracts/GatewayRequest.sol#L15) that our  [Virtual Machine](virtual-machine) can interpret and execute.


### Targets

<i>These methods modifies the target contract for operations that follow.</i>

<MethodPartial 
    description = "Sets the target contract to the specified address."
    js= "setTarget(x: HexString)"
    solidity = "setTarget(address a)" />

<MethodPartial 
    description = "Sets the target contract to the top item on the stack."
    js= "target()"
    solidity = "target()" />

### Slot Manipulation

<i>These methods manipulate the slot from which data will be read when a read command is executed.</i>

<MethodPartial 
    description = {(<>Sets the current slot to <strong>x</strong>.</>)}
    js= "setSlot(x: BigNumberish)"
    solidity = "setSlot(uint256 x)" />

<MethodPartial 
    description = "Sets the current slot to the value at the top of the stack."
    js= "slot()"
    solidity = "slot()" />

<MethodPartial 
    description = {(<>Increments the current slot by <strong>x</strong>.</>)}
    js= "offset(x: BigNumberish)"
    solidity = "offset(uint256 dx)" />

<MethodPartial
