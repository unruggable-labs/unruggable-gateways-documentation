# Quick(ish)start

This quickstart outlines how to deploy a solution for resolving an ENS domain from one of our supported [chains](./chains).

## 1. Initial setup

Run these commands: 

```bash
mkdir quickstart
cd quickstart
git init
forge install https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways
mkdir contracts
```

## 2. Create a `foundry.toml`

- Add the following configuration.

```bash
[profile.default]
src = "contracts"
libs = ["lib"]
solc = "0.8.25"

remappings = [
    "@unruggable=lib/unruggable-gateways/"
]
```

## 2. Deploy a data contract to L2

- Create a file in your `contracts` directory called `L2DataContract.sol`
- Copy the code below.
- Replace `YOUR-ADDRESS-HERE` with your desired resolution address.

**Contract code**

```solidity filename="L2DataContract.sol"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

contract L2DataContract {
    address slot0 = YOUR-ADDRESS-HERE;
}
```

- Replace `YOUR-L2-RPC-URL` with the RPC url for the L2 rollup you want to deploy to.
- Replace `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` with your deployment private key.
- Run the command.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url YOUR-L2-RPC-URL --private-key YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY contracts/L2DataContract.sol:L2DataContract
```

You should get an output similar to the below:

```bash
Deployed to: 0xbf6d2C96547Bb015961cb38D30596a781C7039e1
Transaction hash: 0x734bcee537c67bb4af120189ebdb90afebcdf1422568987a09546a55092808fc
```

## 3. Deploy a resolver to L1

- Create a file in your `contracts` directory called `L1SimpleResolver.sol`
- Copy the code below.

```solidity filename="L1SimpleResolver.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
 
import {GatewayFetcher, GatewayRequest} from "@unruggable/contracts/GatewayFetcher.sol";
import {GatewayFetchTarget} from "@unruggable/contracts/GatewayFetchTarget.sol";
import {IGatewayVerifier} from "@unruggable/contracts/IGatewayVerifier.sol";
  
contract L1SimpleResolver is GatewayFetchTarget {
	using GatewayFetcher for GatewayRequest;
 
	IGatewayVerifier immutable _verifier;
	address immutable _exampleAddress;
 
	constructor(IGatewayVerifier verifier, address exampleAddress) {
		_verifier = verifier;
        _exampleAddress = exampleAddress;
	}
 
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 x) external pure returns (bool) {
		return x == 0x01ffc9a7 /*https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165*/ || x == 0x3b3b57de; /*https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/1*/
	}

    function addr(bytes32 node) public view returns (address) {
 
        GatewayRequest memory r = GatewayFetcher
            .newRequest(1)
            .setTarget(_exampleAddress)
            .setSlot(0)
            .read()
            .setOutput(0);
 
		fetch(_verifier, r, this.addrCallback.selector);    
	}
	
    function addrCallback(bytes[] calldata values, uint8, bytes calldata extraData) external pure returns (address) {
        return abi.decode(values[0], (address));
	}
}
```
- Replace `YOUR-L1-RPC-URL` with the RPC URL for your *Layer 1* node.
- Replace `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY` with your deployment private key.
- Replace `VERIFIER-ADDRESS` with the verifier address for your chosen L2. This can be found [here](/verifier-deployments).

    <p>**!!** Our Sepolia Verifiers/Gateways relax finalization rules for speed of development. [Read more](/verifier-deployments).</p> 
</div>

- Replace `THE-ADDRESS-OF-THE-CONTRACT-YOU-DEPLOYED-IN-THE-LAST-STEP` with.. you guessed it ;)
- Run the command.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url YOUR-L1-RPC-URL --private-key YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY contracts/L1SimpleResolver.sol:L1SimpleResolver --constructor-args VERIFIER-ADDRESS THE-ADDRESS-OF-THE-CONTRACT-YOU-DEPLOYED-IN-THE-LAST-STEP
```

You should get an output similar to the below:

```

```

## 4. Set your resolver

Set the resolver for your ENS name to the address of the deployed L1 Resolver.

You can do this through the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains/). 

**Note:** Make sure you are connected to the correct network (Mainnet, Sepolia, or Holesky).

## 5. Verify

- Verify that your name resolves as expected.

This easiest way to do this is to view your names profile on the ENS App:

```
https://app.ens.domains/YOUR-NAME-HERE.eth
```

For example you can see that [`ethglobal.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/ethglobal.eth) resolves using this exact solution on Sepolia.
