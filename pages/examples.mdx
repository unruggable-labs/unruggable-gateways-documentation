# Examples

The pages contained within this section of the documentation outline conceptually (with code snippets) how to write a virtual machine request (`GatewayRequest`) to read and verify data from another rollup.

For example, there are pages outlining how to:

- [Read value types](/examples/reading-value-types)
- [Read from a Struct](/examples/reading-structs)
- [Read from a mapping](/examples/reading-from-a-mapping)

### TrustedVerifier example

[This example](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways-trusted-verifier-example) demonstrates how to use a `TrustedVerifier` to quickly iterate when developing.

## Typescript examples

We maintain a repository of [gateway examples](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways-examples) that utilize the [Typescript implementation](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways/tree/main/src/vm.ts) of our virtual machine to provide simple, documented examples that can be run with a single line of code. For example:

```bash
bun tsx examples/6-keccak-of-concat-as-key-with-debug.ts
``` 

These examples utilise our npm package [@unruggable/gateways](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unruggable/gateways) which offers a quick and easy way to get started with our codebase.

## Solidity examples

We also maintain a repository that demonstrates full end to end [ENS name resolution](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways-ens-resolution-demos) using the solution.
