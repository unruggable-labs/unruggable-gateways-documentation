# Reading structs

The [solidity storage layout documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html) outlines that *"The elements of structs and arrays are stored after each other, just as if they were given as individual values."*

## Contract definition

```solidity filename="Example.sol"
    contract X {
        struct Item {
            uint256 index;
            string name;
        }
        Item root;   
            
        constructor() {
            root.index = 0;
            root.name = "root";
        }
    }
```

## Reading values

Can have the `name` value of its constructed struct accessed as follows:

```js filename="example.js"

    const OUTPUT_COUNT = 1;
    const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x123..;

    new GatewayRequest(OUTPUT_COUNT)        //Specify the number of outputs
      .setTarget(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)      //Specify the contract address
      .setSlot(0)                       //Specify the slot number
      .push(1)                          //Push the value 1 onto the stack
      .addSlot()                        //Increment the slot ID (by popping 1 from the stack)
      .readBytes()                      //Read the bytes
      .setOutput(0);                    //Set it at output index 0
```
