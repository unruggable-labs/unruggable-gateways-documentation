# TrustedVerifier Quickstart

This quickstart outlines how to get started using a `TrustedVerifier`.

A `TrustedVerifier` allows for verification of signed data from other blockchains **as opposed to using proofs**.

This means that you can validate that your requests work as expected during the development process in advance of deploying your contracts with **real** verifiers.

For further details please see [Verifiers > Development](/verifiers/development).

## 1. Run a trusted gateway

Replace `op` in `trusted:op` with the appropriate chain identifier.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways.git
bun run serve —-latest —-debug trusted:op
```

Further information about running a gateway can be found [here](/running-a-gateway).

## 2. Create a repo and install dependencies

```bash
bun i @unruggable/gateways
bun i @adraffy/blocksmith
```

## 3. Write your contract code

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

import "@unruggable/gateways/GatewayFetchTarget.sol";
import "@unruggable/gateways/GatewayFetcher.sol";
import {Ownable} from '@openzeppelin/access/Ownable.sol';

contract ReaderContract is GatewayFetchTarget, Ownable {

	using GatewayFetcher for GatewayRequest;
	
	IGatewayVerifier immutable _verifier;
	address immutable _target;
	
	constructor(IGatewayVerifier verifier, address target) Ownable(msg.sender) {
		_verifier = verifier;
		_target = target;
	}

	function read() external view returns (uint256) {

		GatewayRequest memory req = GatewayFetcher.newRequest(1)
            .setTarget(_target)
            .setSlot(0)
            .read()
            .setOutput(0);

		fetch(_verifier, req, this.readCallback.selector);
	}

	function readCallback(bytes[] memory values, uint8 /*exitCode*/, bytes memory /*carry*/) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return abi.decode(values[0], (uint256));
	}
}
```

## 4. Deploy your contract

Deploy your contract to a chain of your choice, passing the [deployment address](/verifiers/deployments) for the relevant `TrustedVerifier` and the address of the contract from which you are reading data.

The example code above reads data from our `SlotDataContract`.
