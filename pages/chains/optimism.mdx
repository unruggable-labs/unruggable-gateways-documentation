## Summary

We offer support for two types of rollup based on the [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) stack, namely rollups that **do** implement the OP Stack [fault proof system](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/fault-proofs/explainer) (e.g. Optimism Mainnet) and those that **do not** (e.g. [Base](https://www.base.org/)). For details on the latter please see our documentation for [Base](/chains/base).

- The OP Mainnet chain explorer is found [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/).

## High level overview

Optimism is EVM compatible and implements its account and storage tries using your standard [Patricia Merkle Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/). We verify the returned proofs using Optimism's `SecureMerkleTrie.sol` library.

The `OptimismPortalProxy` implements a getter for the `DisputeGameFactory` through which new `FaultDisputeGame` instances are created. The creation of a `FaultDisputeGame` is the mechanism through which a proposal for the current state root of the chain is made. 

Anyone* can make a state root proposal and the back and forth process through which games are disputed is what prevents an invalid (for [example](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xafbda91446e4cbf3ca4dc0f8c64920be90625c7d0eedc5f4d65b05acaa5a2d58#eventlog)) L2 state being finalized on L1`.

### Context

The context of the request is the game index associated with the latest appropriately resolved `FaultDisputeGame`.

The appropiate index is discerned by querying the latest `rootClaim` from the `AnchorRegistry` and efficiently finding the game that submitted the claim.

### Commit 

The body of an OP stack chain commit includes L2 block data (`blockHash`, `stateRoot`) as well as the hash of the storage trie (`storageRoot`) for the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract. 

### Verification

The Unruggable gateway Typescript prover implementation used for OP Stack based chains is `EthProver.ts`. 

OP Stack chains use the standard Patricia Merkle Trie. Proof data is verified using the `OPVerifier.sol` and `OPFaultVerifier.sol` contracts deployed on Layer 1.

The `OutputRootProof` is [defined by Optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/5a5dd8f44161e8e05093d92b32e102eb38fe78b6/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/libraries/Types.sol#L25-L30) as:

```solidity
    struct OutputRootProof {
        bytes32 version;
        bytes32 stateRoot;
        bytes32 messagePasserStorageRoot;
        bytes32 latestBlockhash;
    }
```

The gateway returns this data alongside individual account/storage proofs for the requested data. We discern that the `OutputRootProof` for the game index that the gateway claims it is returning matches data stored on L1 and then we verify the proofs returned against the associated state root.

### Notes

#### Safeguard consideration

It is not the L1 chain that dictates the state of an OP Stack based chain. Rather, it provides the inputs (transactions/ordering) from which the state of the L2 chain can be derived (in for example the `op-node`/`op-geth` clients).

We read state data from the `AnchorStateRegistry` which critically assumes that all dispute games resolve correctly. It does not take into consideration any of the [safeguards](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/fault-proofs/fp-security#safeguards-within-optimismportal) currently (21/08/24) in place to protect the integrity of the chain, noting that the fault proof system is new, novel, and complex.
