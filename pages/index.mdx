## Introduction

Unruggable Gateways is an [open-source project](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways/tree/main) that provides a complete solution for fetching data from EVM-compatible rollups through contracts deployed on Layer 1 Ethereum mainnet.

This documentation provides:

- An overview of the solution’s [architecture](/architecture)
- Details about the [virtual machine](/virtual-machine)
- Several [examples](/examples) to help you get started

The codebase is designed to be flexible so it can work with new rollups in the future.

## Features

The codebase offers a simple public API and a flexible internal virtual machine.

Key features of the solution include:
- **Multiple targets**. You can fetch data from multiple contracts and use the results of one query as an input into the next.
- **Data manipulation**. You can fetch a piece of data and then manpulate it. For example you could fetch a string and return a its `keccak256` hash or you could return a slice of a larger `bytes` value.
- **Nested requests**. You can nest requests to allow you to do more complicated data manipulation and allow for conditional outputs. There is an example of this more advanced functionality [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/examples) demonstrating the proposed [ENS v2 specification](https://blog.ens.domains/post/ensv2).
